       <p><strong>Dear Valued Customer,</strong></p>
       <p>Thanks for your purchase of the the ultimate guide to Internet marketing for Noobs.</p>
       <p>I know you're going to learn a lot and begin getting traffic and making money from what you'll learn inside the step-by-step guide extremely quickly.</p>
       <p>Although the guide you just purchased is easy-to-follow and incredibly in-depth, I have a special offer that's ONLY available to existing customers that will help you see results EVEN faster.</p>
       <p>Did you know that many people learn MUCH faster by watching something done rather than reading about it?</p>
       <p>In fact, a majority of the population are visual learners and learn much faster from a video than by reading the text-based version of something.</p>
		
       <h3 align="center"><strong>Do You Want To Get The Best Results<br> As Quickly As Possible?</strong></h3>
  	   <div class="line-bd"></div><br>
       <p>If so, the video upgrade to the guide you just purchased is for you.</p>
       <p>It's the same great content that you'll find inside the text-based version of the training, but we've recorded it all in high-quality video format that make getting started even easier.</p>

       <img align="right" src="images/video-demo.jpg" width="400">
       <p>I mentioned before that Internet marketing is one of the best and fastest ways to promote any business online...</p>
       <p>But that's only IF you know what you're doing.</p>
       <p>There are little things in every single online marketing campaign that be the difference between getting traffic and making money and falling flat on your face.</p>
       <p>With Internet marketing, you can get tons of traffic and make a lot of money, but you MUST understand and comprehend EVERY SINGLE DETAIL that you're being taught inside the training.</p>
       <p>Of course, you may be one of those people that prefers to read a 
	   report, follow what's inside it, and then you'll actually apply what you 
	   learn to see results</p>
       <p>But, most people NEED a hands-on, do this and then do thatï¿½ approach that only video training can provide...</p>

    <p>That's exactly what the video version of the course is all about</p>
		<p>presenting the content in a format that makes learning, applying what you learn, and seeing success quickly and efficiently.</p>
